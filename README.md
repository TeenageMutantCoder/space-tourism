### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://sw-space-tourism.netlify.app/](https://sw-space-tourism.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

While building this website from the Figma design, I learned many things. This is the second project that I have built from someone else's design, and I

I learned:

- How to use Styled Components, a tool I had never used before
- How to create a TypeScript declaration file for imported image assets
- About the partiallyActive prop that allows Gatsby Links to be active when the user is inside a nested route

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to write automated tests for my code. I will always probably do some manual QA, but understanding how to write good tests is essential to being a good developer, especially if someone wants to work on a large or impactful project.

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44717164/unable-to-import-svg-files-in-typescript/45887328#45887328) - This stack overflow answer helped me fix the TypeScript errors that came up when I tried to import an svg, png, or jpg file.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This website is essential for a web developer. It contains all of the necessary information regarding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used it very often.
